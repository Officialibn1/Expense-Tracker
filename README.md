# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Currently Just the UI design of a Expense Tracking App without a backend database,

I'll add a database to it in the future but I'll focus on giving it a good looking UI for now.

I'll be using styled-components sometimes in the app so make sure to install it using

### npm i `styled-components`
